  <h1>Attributes</h1>
  <h2>Attributes are something which give additional information to elements or you can say tags (ELEMENTS=TAGS) </h2>
  <h3>HREF ( HYPER LINK ) </h3>
  <p>Ever wondered when we click a text we are navigated to some site? </p>
  <p>This is how it's done  < a href="wwww.facebook.com"> Click to goto facebook < /a></p>
  <p>Example:  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/" > Click to goto facebook </a></p>
  <p>Now when you click "Click to goto facebook" you will be navigated to facebook website.</p>
  <p>But have you noticed something?...?? The same page is loaded to facebook. </p>
  <p>You can use Target attribute to open facebook in new tab.</p>
  <p>Example:  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank"> Click to goto facebook </a></p>
  <hr>
  <h3>SRC</h3>
  <p>src is used with image tag which specifies path of the image and alt is used if in case the picture is not loaded so it will show the text written in alt.</p>
  <p>Example: < img src="anypicture.jpg" alt=""></></p>
  <img src="picture.jpg" alt="Picture here of a laptop" width="450" height="250">
  <p>1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website.<bt></bt> Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".<br> <br>

    Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed.<br> <br>
    
    2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".<br>
    
    Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain.</p><hr>
    <h3>STYLE </h3>
    <p>The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.</p>
      <p>< p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.< /p></p>
      <p>Example: <p style="color:red">This is a red paragraph</p></p>
